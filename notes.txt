Dependabot alert 2022-04-22
Prototype Pollution in minimist #22

Ran npm audit --production and 1 warning showed. After running npm audit fix and then again running npm audit --production there was no warning. 

When I pushed the updates to github this dependabot warning was automatically registered as fixed.

Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity in nth-check #9

"As Dan Abramov explains in this issue, it is (very likely) a false alarm and can be safely dismissed.

More specifically, if you are using CRA and nth-check is referenced only from it, it is not an issue, because CRA is a build tool and the vulnerable code will never get into the resulting application bundle and thus will never be called by client code.

You can verify this by moving "react-scripts" into "devDependencies" in package.json and running npm audit --production."

dissmissed as risk tolerable in this project. I also checked that I have the latest version of react scripts. I had udated to the latest react scripts earlier this week.
